Steps for estimating a times series model are:
Graph the data series to see what patterns are present – trend, cycle, seasonal, and random
Test data for Stationarity with a Dickie Fuller Test
If original series is not stationary then difference it until it is 
Number of Differences (d) to make a series stationary is determined using the D-F Test
Use the stationary (differenced) data series to determine the number of Lags that best forecasts the historical period
Estimate the AR(p,q) Model and make a forecast

The major components of such a model are usually the following:
A base level
A trend
Cyclic fluctuations

Data Preparation:
Plot data and examine for stationarity
Examine ACF for stationarity
If not stationary, take first differences
If variance appears non-constant, take logarithm before first differencing
Examine the ACF after these transformations to determine if the series is now stationary

Model Identification and Estimation:
Examine the ACF and PACF’s of your (now) stationary series to get some ideas about what ARIMA(p,d,q) models to estimate.
Estimate these models
Examine the parameter estimates, the SBC statistic and test of white noise for the residuals.

Forecasting:
Use the best model to construct forecasts
Graph your forecasts against actual values
Calculate the Mean Squared Error for the forecasts

Time Series Analysis Assumptions:
Assume series you are forecasting is really random 
Assume the variability is constant i.e., the same for the future as for the past, in other words
